##NOTE:

# The model still failed when training on dynamic data and validating on homemade data. The final val_loss was inorder of 0.01

# I will now try to train on both homemade and dynamic data and validate on homemade data:
        # You can see that the val loss just starts off being low and continues that way. 
        # There is something critically different in the loss calculation between both the original and homemade data.
